\title{Discordance measure calculated from the additive approach}
\usage{
Add_Discord(dataset)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A numeric matrix with extreme air temperature data from multiple sites.
The first column must contain the years, and the remaining columns contain
temperature data from each site.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with 8 columns:
\describe{
\item{Local}{Site identifier.}
\item{SampleSize}{Number of observations for each site.}
\item{l_1}{L-moment ratio (mean).}
\item{l_2}{L-moment ratio (L-scale).}
\item{t_3}{L-moment ratio (L-skewness).}
\item{t_4}{L-moment ratio (L-kurtosis).}
\item{t_5}{L-moment ratio (higher-order L-moment).}
\item{discord}{Discordance statistic indicating potential outlier status.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Hosking and Wallis' discordance measure using an additive approach,
as proposed in Martins et al. (2022) \url{doi:10.1590/1678-4499.20220061}.
The discordance measure identifies sites that are potentially discordant within a regional
frequency analysis framework for extreme air temperature series.
}
\details{
The discordance measure is computed using the squared Mahalanobis distance
between the site's L-moment ratios and the regional average, based on the additive
approach to regional frequency analysis.
